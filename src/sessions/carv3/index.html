        <p>Cars as a transport protocol for moving data are beginning to supercede bitswap, but comes with limitations. The trustless gateway protocol does not directly yield an intuitive way for a client to retrieve a file from multiple origins. Providing authentication or indications of partial transmission end up with an unclear home between HTTP transport and application level semantics.</p>

        <p>Despite these hurdles, the car format continues to perform well and demonstrates sufficient flexibility to meet increasing demands on it.</p>
