        <p>Building “the web3 way” is hard. Iroh helps get you past the basic "food, water & shelter" frustrations of just getting computers to consistently connect and sending data around.</p>

        <p>Iroh is a new IPFS node written in Rust, designed to connect and persist across many different endpoints. Written as a Rust library, you can run the server node today, or combine it with your existing web3 Rust code to add performant networking and content addressing to your network.</p>

        <p>This talk will dive into the design of Iroh and how to get started using it today.</p>
