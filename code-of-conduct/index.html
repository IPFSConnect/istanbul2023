            </div>
            <p>In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, all attendees, organizers, contributors, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and employees at IPFS Connect pledge to accept and observe the following Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is in effect throughout the conference, including within associated online communities, (e.g. Discord, and elsewhere leading up to and after the event). Cooperation from everyone will help ensure a safe environment for all.</p>
            <p>IPFS Connect is for anyone interested in exploring, learning, and forming connections about and through the future of computing while doing so in a fun, engaging and respectful environment.</p>
            <p>Our conference is dedicated to being a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or any other dimension of diversity.</p>
            <p>Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, break-out rooms, conference-related social events, conference-related online forums, and on social media. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down people within the community. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for IPFS Connect. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference (including potential future events hosted by Fission) without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
            <p>IPFS Connect will post a transparency report after the conference to respond to any incidents related-to or violations of the Code of Conduct that do occur.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Spelling it out</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or actions related to or involving:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>background</li>
                <li>gender</li>

                <li>harassing photography or recording</li>
                <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Contributors to the conference, event-related sites, and/or our interactive communities (e.g. Discord), sponsors or similar, are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Organizers (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
            <p>Anyone asked to stop abusive, harassing, or otherwise unnacceptable behaviour are expected to comply immediately and accept the response decided on by conference organizers.</p>
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns related to abusive or unnacceptable behavior or content, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
            <p>We expect everyone to follow these rules at conference venues and conference-related social events. Be kind, inclusive, and considerate. Here are a few examples on how you can go about doing that:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>Look for and read participants pronoun badges/stickers.</li>
                <li>Write your own pronoun badge/sticker.If there’s an opportunity to ask questions, ask constructive questions instead of trying to make a statement about your knowledge or work.</li>
                <li>Respect attendees’ boundaries, especially on what they choose to share or not share about themselves.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Need help?</h2>
